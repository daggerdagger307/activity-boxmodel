        <p><strong>The Hundreds</strong> apparel is inspired by <em>LOS ANGELES LIFESTYLE / CALIFORNIA CULTURE</em> and Southern California’s skateboarding, surf, punk, and hip-hop cultures. The design is reminiscent of 1980s surf-culture t-shirts, independent skateboard company apparel of the 1990s, and the advent of “streetwear” at the end of the millennium. The line is comprised of graphic t-shirts, denim, wovens, fleece, outerwear, headwear, and accessories. In late 2008, <strong>The Hundreds</strong> also launched a shoe program monikored <strong>The Hundreds Footwear</strong>. And in 2009, <strong>The Hundreds’</strong> optical program, <strong>The Hundreds Eyewear</strong>, debuted to the public. </p>

        <p>Currently, <strong>The Hundreds</strong> is stocked in over 400 accounts in every major city of the world. This includes The Hundreds’ four flagship retail locations in the Fairfax District of Los Angeles, <strong>The Hundreds</strong> store in San Francisco’s Union Square, The Hundreds New York in SoHo, and The Hundreds Santa Monica.</p>
        
        <p>More than just an online magazine or clothing line, <strong>The Hundreds</strong> is a lifestyle project that remains personal and direct, reflective of the community and culture, and dedicated to its fanbase. <strong>The Hundreds</strong> is <em>Huge</em>. </p>
